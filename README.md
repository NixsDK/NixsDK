I'm a motivated and adaptable front-end programmer with a solid foundation in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**, eager to keep growing and taking on new challenges.  
I love designing interactive, user-friendly interfaces and building web applications that not only work but also look great.

Though I've tried frameworks like Laravel in the past, my current obsession is front-end refinement â€” improving layouts, styling with **Bootstrap**, adding interactivity with **JavaScript**, and exploring modern tech like **Vue.js**.

I also have experience using **Git** and version control workflows to collaborate and manage projects effectively.

I'm continuously learning through both personal and academic projects. My goal is to become a versatile programmer capable of delivering polished front-end experiences while understanding how to integrate back-end code when needed.
