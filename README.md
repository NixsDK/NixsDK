<sub> Im a motivated and adaptable front-end programmer with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, eager to keep growing and taking on new challenges. I love designing interactive, user-friendly interfaces and building web applications that dont only work but also look great to use.<sub>
<sub>Though Ive tried frameworks like Laravel in the past, my new obsession lies more on the front-end: improving layouts, styling with Bootstrap, adding interactivity with JavaScript, and learning about modern technologies such as Vue. js. I also have experience with Git and version control workflows to collaborate effectively and manage projects effectively.<sub>
<sub>Im continuously learning my skills, working on personal and academic projects that improve both my technical skills and problem-solving attitude. My aim is to become a versatile programmer who can deliver well-structured, polished front-end experiences while still understanding and integrating back-end code as required.<sub>
